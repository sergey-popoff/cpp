Hello, I read your post. I feel that this question is tougher than it looks, or I should say the answer could be complicated. As you probably already know, the average undergraduate class (first semester or first year) is usually filled with students whose analytical, mathematical, and programming abilities vary drastically. Some will have taking through Calculus (or further), while some may have barely placed out of algebra. There might be some geniuses in the class, whose IQ's and analytical levels are greater than the professors, and there might be some who are lacking in the area of analytical reasoning. Some of the students may have never written a line of code, while some of the others, who are self taught, might have coded 10's of thousands of lines of code across, half dozen languages. With that said, it might be hard to come up with something across the board that fits everyone.

Now with all the statements that have been made in the previous paragraph, the easy way to teach programming, especially from an Object Oriented stand point since its so popular, would be to start small and build upon those principles. But on occasion expose the students to some principles outside of the Object Oriented paradigm.

1) Assignment, operators, statements, simple (or primitive) data types, strings, basic class creation, and compilation

MAKE THEM CODE!

2) Conditional statements, control structures, blocks, basic iteration, maybe nested control structures.

MAKE THEM CODE!

3) Functions (or methods) creation and abstraction, Additional class (beyond the main) creation and abstraction, containers and constructed data types (e.g. arrays, lists), and iteration of those containers

BEGIN TALKING AND EXPLAINING THE CONCEPTS OF WHAT OBJECTS ARE BETWEEN NUMBER 2, AND NUMBER 4 (PROBABLY THE REST OF THE COURSE)

MAKE THEM CODE!

4) Depending on the language: structs and unions (or user defined data types), inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, possibly more advanced graphics programming (depending on the languages), maybe some type of sorting algorithms using multiple iterations.

MAKE THEM CODE!

5) OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN PATTERNS AND ALGORITHMS

Most importantly, they should learn how to think about the paradigm, and about the language that they are learning. The only way that they can become a better programmer is to read and write code! The students should build strong coding fundamentals, and also develop a perspective of the language that they are using, and be able to apply those principles (with in reason) to other languages of that paradigm.

Don't give the students some wack ass assignments, that are way outside the breadth of what they've learned; that inevitably hurt their growth as programmers! But they should definitely be assigned many coding assignments. They should code many programs in that class.

I had a Java professor who would assign 10 programs, or more, a week; the semester I had him. I love/loved him for it, it kept me coding (kept the skills sharp)! Most of the textbooks have great deal of end of the chapter questions, stick with those, or manipulate the examples in the book to create programming assignments out of them. Thats only way that it be fair across the board.

I hope this helps.
