My Summary:
==========
solve problem vs create features
1. state the problem
2. understand: facts, context, constraints
2.1. what don't you know?
2.2. related problems out there?
3. be discerning
3.1. problems & tradeoffs in your solutions: technical, logical - solve
3.2. there should be questions
tradeoffs: you need at least 2 alternative solutions to compare
4. focus
4.1. get away from computer
4.2. tradeoffs: balls will be dropped
5. two minds
5.1. waking mind: tactical/analytical
5.1.1. make it feed background mind
5.1.2. analyse background mind output
5.2. background mind: synthesis, strategy, abstractions
5.2.1. only can feed it, not direct it
5.2.2. make a problem a days' agenda to feed it into your background
6. 7+-2
7. hammock time: NO INPUT! close your eyes - recall the problem in your imagination
8. wait - at least overnight or over month
8.1. switch to another things (not withing a day), don't stuck
8.2. capture idea when it appear
8.3. try it
8.3.1. type sparingly - small solution is good
8.3.2. feedback is important - don't lean on it
8.4. you may be wrong
8.4.1. don't be afraid of being wrong
